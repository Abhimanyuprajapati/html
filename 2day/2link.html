    <h1>International financial institutions</h1>
    <p>
        An international financial institution (IFI) is a financial institution
         that has been established (or chartered) by more than one country, 
         and hence is subject to international law. Its owners or shareholders
          are generally national governments, although other international institutions 
          and other organizations occasionally figure as shareholders. 
          The most prominent IFIs are creations of multiple nations, although some
           bilateral financial institutions (created by two countries) exist and are 
           technically IFIs.
            The best known IFIs were established after World War II to assist in the
             reconstruction of Europe and provide mechanisms for international 
             cooperation in managing the global financial system.
