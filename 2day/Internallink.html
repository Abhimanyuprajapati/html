    <h1>World Bank</h1>

    <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small>
    <p>Not to be confused with <a href="1link.html">World Bank Group</a>.</p>
    <p align="justify">The World Bank is an <a href="2link.html">international financial institution</a> that provides <a href="3link.html">loans</a>and <a href="4link.html">grants</a> to the governments of <a href="5link.html">low</a>
        and <a href="6link.html">middle-income countries</a> for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.
        The World Bank is the collective name for the <a href="7link.html">International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)</a> and
        International Development Association (IDA), two of five international organizations owned by the World Bank
        Group. It was established along with the International Monetary Fund at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. After
        a slow start, its first loan was to France in 1947. In the 1970s, it focused on loans to developing world
        countries, shifting away from that mission in the 1980s. For the last 30 years, it has included NGOs and
        environmental groups in its loan portfolio. Its loan strategy is influenced by the Sustainable Development Goals
        as well as environmental and social safeguards.

        As of 2022, the World Bank is run by a president and 25 executive directors, as well as 29 various vice
        presidents. IBRD and IDA have 189 and 174 member countries, respectively. The U.S., Japan, China, Germany and
        the U.K. have the most voting power. The bank aims loans at developing countries to help reduce poverty. The
        bank is engaged in several global partnerships and initiatives, and takes a role in working toward addressing
        climate change. The World Bank operates a number of training wings and it works with the Clean Air Initiative
        and the UN Development Business. It works within the Open Data Initiative and hosts an Open Knowledge
        Repository.

        The World Bank has been criticized as promoting inflation and harming economic development, causing protests in
        1988 and 2000. There has also been criticism of the bank's governance and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
